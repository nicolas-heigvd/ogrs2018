abstract="Historical photographs are a very rich source of information that can be useful in a variety of different contexts such as environmental analyses, land planning and illustration of landscape evolution. However to reach this goal the images must be accurately georeferenced. In this paper we propose to use the crowd to perform the 3D georeferencing of collections of historical images. To this goal we implemented a web 3D georeferencer that offers volunteers the possibility to semi-automatically identify 1. the location of the point from where a picture has been taken, 2. the three angles: tilt, roll and yaw and 3. the field of view. A virtual web-based globe is the central element in this tool that allows both for the georeferencing in three dimensions by volunteers and for the visualization of georeferenced images to assess the landscape variation through time. In this paper we evaluate the method and the georeferencer and give suggestions for further developments and exploitation of the database.",

abstract="Is it possible to determine the location of a photo from just its pixels? While the general problem seems exceptionally difficult, photos often contain cues such as landmarks, weather patterns, vegetation, road markings, or architectural details, which in combination allow to infer where the photo was taken. Previously, this problem has been approached using image retrieval methods. In contrast, we pose the problem as one of classification by subdividing the surface of the earth into thousands of multi-scale geographic cells, and train a deep network using millions of geotagged images. We show that the resulting model, called PlaNet, outperforms previous approaches and even attains superhuman accuracy in some cases. Moreover, we extend our model to photo albums by combining it with a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. By learning to exploit temporal coherence to geolocate uncertain photos, this model achieves a 50 {\%} performance improvement over the single-image model.",

abstract="In this chapter, we explore the task of global image geolocalization---estimating where on the Earth a photograph was captured. We examine variants of the ``im2gps'' algorithm using millions of ``geotagged'' Internet photographs as training data. We first discuss a simple to understand nearest-neighbor baseline. Next, we introduce a lazy-learning approach with more sophisticated features that doubles the performance of the original ``im2gps'' algorithm. Beyond quantifying geolocalization accuracy, we also analyze (a) how the nonuniform distribution of training data impacts the algorithm (b) how performance compares to baselines such as random guessing and land-cover recognition and (c) whether geolocalization is simply landmark or ``instance level'' recognition at a large scale. We also show that geolocation estimates can provide the basis for image understanding tasks such as population density estimation or land cover estimation. This work was originally described, in part, in ``im2gps'' [9] which was the first attempt at global geolocalization using Internet-derived training data.",
